  <h4>Problem Faced</h4>
  <p>
    Low-level disputes between people
  </p>

  <h4>Solution</h4>
  <p>
    <b>Both|SIDES</b>.  We allow customers to post  disputes and bring neutral voters to adjudicate.
  </p>

  <h4>Rationale</h4>
  <p>This is what our whole political/legal system is based on: Democracy.  Only, instead of representative democracy, we ACTUALLY vote on our fellow citizenâ€™s problems!
  </p>

  <h4>Value Prop</h4>
  <p>1.  Bringing people to view and vote on a person's dispute.<br>2.  Customization of demographics to view your dispute (i.e. education level, geographic area, specific areas of interest, NOT race or gender because of inherent biases in sample)<br>3.  Multiple possible solutions
  </p>

  <h4>Business Model</h4>
  <p>Freemium<br>Pay to post if dispute is over more than 20 dollars<br>Pay for demographic customization<br>Pay for multiple resolution options
  </p>

  <h4>Challenges Faced</h4>
  <p><b>1.  Customer Confidence</b>  This is a tough one.  It IS possible to make disputes binding upon customers, but hard to enforce.  Possibility of insuring disputes.  May opt-in to appeal process.<br><b>2.  Voter Trolling</b>  Related to Consumer Confidence.  There will be people who troll.  To combat this problem, there will be an overisght system on voters.  If you vote in a dispute and you're on the side with less than 10% (hope to lower it to 5% as sample size gets larger) of votes you will be put on a probationary period for two weeks.  If it happens again, you will be suspended as a voter for one month.  You may appeal this decision with a written, one-sided poll open for twenty-four hours.<br><b>3.  Getting Voters</b>  Marketing.  There may be a portion of the population that just likes to vote.  However, we will market to voters as well as customers.  Offer a $1,000 prize to first voter with 10,000 votes.  Most Influential Page of voters for Day, Month, Year, All-Time.  Make people feel important for performing a "civic duty" for their fellow person.
